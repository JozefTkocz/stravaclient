# Python Strava Client
A convenient Python client for interacting with the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/).

To access the API, you will need to register an API application as described [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account). 
Once you have a `client_id` and `client_secret` from Strava, you will be able to run the example script in `example.py` 
to see how you can conveniently interact with the API. 

### Installation
The client is most easily installed using pip:
```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/JozefTkocz/stravaclient
```
